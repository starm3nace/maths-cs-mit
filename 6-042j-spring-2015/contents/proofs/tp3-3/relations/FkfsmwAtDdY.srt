1
00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:02,370
PROFESSOR: We've seen
a lot of functions

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,320
in introductory calculus-- trig
functions, rational functions,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,900
exponentials, logs and so on.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,690
I don't know whether
your calculus course

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,250
has included a general
discussion of functions.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,500
The old fashioned ones didn't,
and we will go into that

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,430
now in this segment.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,290
And we're going to be
interpreting functions

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,720
as a special case
of binary relations.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
So let's just say what
a binary relation is.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,170
A binary relation is
a mathematical object

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,420
that associates
elements of one set

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,270
called the domain with
elements of another set

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,440
called the codomain.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,380
And I'm going to give
you a bunch of examples

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,380
of binary relations
in a short moment,

17
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,788
but let's just talk
about what they're for

18
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:46,370
and what their role is.

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,740
So they may be familiar to
you as computer scientists

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,980
if you've worked with any
relational databases like SQL

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,340
or MySQL.

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,040
MySQL.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,440
And we'll see an
example that indicates

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,000
where the original ideas behind
those relational databases

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,450
came from.

26
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,400
But even more
fundamental, relations

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,420
are one of the most basic
mathematical abstractions right

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,960
after sets, and they
play a role everywhere.

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,370
We're going to be
looking in later lectures

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,000
at special kinds
of binary relations

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,330
like equivalence relations
and partial orders

32
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,930
and numerical congruences.

33
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,390
But today, we're going
to set up the machinery

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,600
to be using binary
relations for counting,

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,840
which will be another important
application in this class.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,290
So let's look at an example.

37
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,860
And I'm going to take one that's
close to home-- the registered

38
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,070
for relation, which is a
relation between students--

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,890
that's going to be the
domain, in this case, four

40
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,510
students, Jason, Joan, Yihui,
and Adam-- and four subjects.

41
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:10,080
As a coincidence, 6.042,
003, 012, and 004.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,340
And the relation R is
going to be indicated

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,270
by arrows which show just
which students are associated

44
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,990
with which subjects,
meaning that they're

45
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,990
registered for that subject.

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,650
So if we look at
Jason, we can see

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,420
that there's a particular arrow
connecting Jason and 6.042.

48
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,080
And what that tells us is that
Jason is registered for 6.042.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
Now, there's a
bunch of notations

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,460
that are used with respect
to binary relations.

51
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,770
So let's look at some.

52
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,540
One way to write
it is if you think

53
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,120
of the relation R
as an equality sign

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,380
or a less than sign,
where it's normally

55
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,820
written in the middle
of the two things

56
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,430
that it's connecting, as in
this example-- Jason R 6.042.

57
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,230
That would be called
infix notation.

58
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,925
Sometimes it's written
as a binary predicate-- R

59
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,770
of Jason comma 6.042.

60
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,950
That would be kind
of prefix notation

61
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,830
where the relation or
operator comes first.

62
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,560
And then if you start
being a little closer

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,360
to the formal definition of
what a binary relation is,

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,160
you could say that the
ordered pair Jason 6.042

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,252
is a member of the relation.

66
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,710
If you wanted to
be really precise,

67
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,660
you would say that
it was a member

68
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,950
of the graph of the relation.

69
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,250
And I'll come back
and elaborate further

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,460
on what the graph
of a relation is

71
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,730
and what this ordered
pairs businesses.

72
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,390
But for now, just let's
continue with this example.

73
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,110
And a basic concept
with relations

74
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,530
is the idea of the image
of a bunch of domain

75
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,160
elements under the relation.

76
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,290
So you can think of the
relation as an operator

77
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,250
that applies to domain
elements or even sets

78
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,700
of domain elements.

79
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,250
So if I write R of Jason,
that defines the subjects

80
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,840
that Jason is registered for.

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,770
So looking at the picture,
R is not a function.

82
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,040
So that there may be more
than one subject, as is

83
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,269
you'd expect for a student to be
registered for multiple courses

84
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,730
at MIT.

85
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,020
So Jason in this diagram is
registered for 6.042 and 6.012

86
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,730
as indicated by the
highlighted two connection

87
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,030
arrows, which we've made red.

88
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,770
Which means that R
of Jason is that set

89
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,720
of two courses that
he's associated with

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,540
or that are associated
with him-- that he's

91
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,540
registered 6.042 and 6.012.

92
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,770
So at this point,
we've applied R

93
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,430
to one domain element--
one student Jason.

94
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,730
But the interesting
case is when you apply R

95
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,810
to a bunch of students.

96
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,460
So the general
setup is that if x

97
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,210
is a set of students-- a subset
of the domain, which we've

98
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,390
been showing in green--
then if I apply R to X,

99
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,250
it gives me all the
subjects that they're

100
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,870
taking among them-- all the
subjects that any one of them

101
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,820
is taking.

102
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,600
Let's take a look at an example.

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,860
Well, another way to say
it I guess is that R of X

104
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,080
is everything in R that
relates to things in X.

105
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,930
So if I look at
Jason and Yihui and I

106
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,450
want to know what do
they connect to under R--

107
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,090
these are the subjects
that Jason or Yihui

108
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,420
is registered for.

109
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,220
The way I'd find that is by
looking at the arrow diagram,

110
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,970
and I'd find that Jason
is taking 042 and 012.

111
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,730
And Yihui is taking 012 and 004.

112
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,170
So between them, they're
taking three courses.

113
00:05:51,170 --> 00:06:01,340
So R of Jason, Yihui is
in fact 042, 012, and 004.

114
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,150
So another way to understand
this idea of the image of a set

115
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,290
R of X is that X is a
set of points in the set

116
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,770
that you're starting
with called the domain.

117
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,940
And R of X is going to be all of
the endpoints in the other set,

118
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,970
the codomain, that start at X.

119
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,110
If I said that as a statement
in formal logic or in set theory

120
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,020
with logical notation,
I would say that R of X

121
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,960
is the set of j in
subjects such that there

122
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,260
is a d in X such that dRj.

123
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,050
So what that's exactly
saying that dRj

124
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,170
says that d is the starting
point in the domain.

125
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,380
d is a student.

126
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,100
j is a subject.

127
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,900
dRj means there's an arrow
that goes from student

128
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,120
d to subject j.

129
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,600
And we're collecting the set of
those j's that started some d.

130
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,930
So an arrow from X
goes to j is what

131
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:18,757
exists at d an X. dRj means--
written in logic notation--

132
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:20,840
it's really talking about
the endpoints of arrows,

133
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,580
and that's a nice way
to think about it.

134
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,560
But you ought to be
able also to retreat

135
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,010
to give a nice, crisp
set theoretic definition

136
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,870
without reference to
pictures if need be.

137
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,550
So that's an official
definition of the image under R.

138
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,190
Let's turn now to an
operation on relations which

139
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,350
converts one relation
into another relation

140
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,510
called the inverse of
R. And the inverse of R

141
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,780
is what you get by
turning the arrows around.

142
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,270
So let's look at the
relation R, which

143
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,320
is the registered for
relation going from d students

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
to j subjects.

145
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,540
And then if I look at
R inverse, R inverse

146
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,550
I could think of as the
registers relation-- 6.042

147
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,460
registers Jason, and 6.012
registers Jason and Yihui.

148
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,060
It's a funny usage of the word,
but I needed something short

149
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,670
that would fit on the slide.

150
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,600
So registers is basically
turning the arrows backwards of

151
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,820
is registered for.

152
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,780
And now I can apply
the definition of image

153
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,010
to R inverse in a useful way.

154
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,120
But just to be crisp about
what we're doing here

155
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,590
is formally our
inverse is gotten

156
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,260
by flipping the role of the
domain and the codomain.

157
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:42,960
So we have that dRj if
and only if jR inverse d.

158
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,010
So let's look at R
inverse of 6.012.

159
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,610
What that's going to
mean is all the students

160
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,040
that are taking 6.012.

161
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,060
So we start off at 6.012, and
we go back to all the students

162
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,830
that are registered for it.

163
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,300
It's Jason and Yihui again.

164
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,480
And so our inverse of
6.012 is Jason and Yihui.

165
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,870
Our inverse of 6.012 and 6.003?

166
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,880
Well, it's same deal.

167
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,650
Let's look at 6.003 and 6.012
and look at all the students

168
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,600
that are registered
for either one of them.

169
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,270
Now its Jason, Joan, and Yihui
shown by those red arrows--

170
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,430
all the arrows coming out of
those two courses, 003 and 012.

171
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,570
And so our inverse of 003
and 012 is that set of three

172
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,430
students-- Jason,
Joan, and Yihui.

173
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,850
And in general,
when you start off

174
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,310
with a bunch of subjects--
a bunch of elements--

175
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,560
of the codomain and you
apply R inverse to it,

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,320
it's called the inverse
image of the Y under R.

177
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,290
Well, let's look at the
set J of all the subjects

178
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,160
and think about what
is R inverse of J. What

179
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,900
does it mean?

180
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,730
Well, R inverse of J
is all the students

181
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,330
that are registered
for some subject

182
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,850
at all, which is a
good thing to have.

183
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,070
So now, I can start using
these sets to make assertions

184
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,160
about my database that
can be useful to know.

185
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
So for example, if I want
to say that every student is

186
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,980
registered for some
subject-- which, of course,

187
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,670
they are-- what I
would say is that D,

188
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:28,240
the set of all students, is
a subset of R inverse of J.

189
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,090
So this concise set theoretic
containment statement--

190
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,970
d is a subset of
R inverse of J--

191
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,910
is a slick way of writing
the precise statement that

192
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:47,125
says that all the students are
registered for some subject.

193
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,750
Now, happens not to
be true by the way.

194
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,930
Because if you look
back at that example,

195
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,584
Adam was not registered
for a subject.

196
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,250
So we're not claiming
that this is true,

197
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,530
but simply that
there's a nice way

198
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:03,070
to express it using
images and containment.

199
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,730
Let's look at a
different relation

200
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,490
that we could call
the advises relation.

201
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,620
So the advises relation's
going to have codomain

202
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,700
the same set of students d, but
it's going to have as a domain

203
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,790
the set of professors.

204
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,760
And I've written down
the initials of five

205
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,590
prominent professors
minus at the top--

206
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,900
and you may recognize
some of the others.

207
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,540
But it doesn't really
matter if you don't.

208
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,080
And the advises
relation V is going

209
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,920
to be indicated by those arrows.

210
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,290
So in particular,
it shows that ARM

211
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,430
is the adviser of Jason,
Joan, Yihui, and Adam,

212
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,440
which he happens to be.

213
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,210
FTL is an adviser
of Joan and Yihui.

214
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,590
So Joan has two advisers
because she's a double major.

215
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,640
Yihui does as well.

216
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,755
And Adam does as well now
that I look at this example.

217
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:03,750
So if I look at in particular
now the advisees of FTL or TLP,

218
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,060
I'm looking at V of the set
consisting of FTL and TLP.

219
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,390
And it's going to be
Joan, Yihui, and Adam.

220
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,140
So taking the image
of FTL and TLP--

221
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,890
that's the set of advisees of
either of those two professors,

222
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,470
I get this set of
three students--

223
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,250
Joan, Yihui, and Adam.

224
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,910
Well, that's a set of students,
and the registered relation

225
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,190
applies to a set of students.

226
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,550
So let's do that.

227
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,980
If I now apply R
to Joan and Yihui

228
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,370
and Adam, what I'm
getting is the subjects

229
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,070
that they're registered for.

230
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,600
So this is called composing R
and V. I've applied V and them

231
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,940
I'm applying R to the result.

232
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,190
In this case, R of
V of FTL and TLP

233
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,790
is the same as R of
Joan, Yihui, and Adam.

234
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,676
It's the courses that any of
them are taking, and it's 003,

235
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,480
012, and 004.

236
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,050
So the way to understand
this R of V in general

237
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,700
is you start off with any set
X of professors in the domain.

238
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,920
You take V of W-- are the
advisees that they have have--

239
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,800
and then you take
R of the advisees,

240
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,060
and you get the subjects
that the advisees are taking.

241
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,110
So R of V of X is the subjects
that advisees of X are taking,

242
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,590
are registered for.

243
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,780
Well, we can abstract
that out and call

244
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,840
this the composition of R and
V. It's defined the same way

245
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,610
that functional composition is.

246
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,690
So R of V is the relation and
the images of that relation.

247
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,220
The images of a set of
professors under R of V

248
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:55,550
is defined to be apply V to
X and then apply R to V of X.

249
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,160
And it's again, called the
composition of R and V.

250
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,460
What it means now is that two
things are related by R of V.

251
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,790
It relates professors
and subjects.

252
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,910
And it says that a
professor in a subject

253
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,070
are related if the professor
has an advisee-- some advisee--

254
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,700
in that subject.

255
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,420
p for a professor.

256
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,610
Composition of R with
V. j for a subject

257
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,770
holds if and only if
professor p has an advisee

258
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,650
registered in subject j.

259
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,650
Let's see how you figure
that kind of thing out.

260
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,010
So I'm going to draw
the V relation which

261
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,380
goes from p professors
to D students

262
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,220
and then the R relation
that goes from D students

263
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,350
to J subjects.

264
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,410
And by showing
them in this way, I

265
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,930
can understand the
composition of R and V

266
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,210
as following two arrows.

267
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:58,430
You start off, say, at ARM, and
you follow a V arrow from ARM

268
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,140
to his advisee, Yihui.

269
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,050
Then you follow another
arrow from Yihui to 6.012,

270
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,900
and you discover, hey,
ARM has an advisee in--

271
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,910
So now we can say that
professor ARM is in the relation

272
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,890
R composed with V with
6.012 because of this path

273
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:27,490
ARM has Yihui as an advisee, and
Yihui is registered for 6.012.

274
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,170
And this relation R
o V, we figured out,

275
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,910
is the relation
that the professor

276
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,750
has an advisee in the subject.

277
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,740
So in general,
what we can say is

278
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,820
that a professor p is
in the R o V relation

279
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,290
to j if and only
if-- and here we're

280
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,540
going to state it in formal
logical notation, which

281
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,950
really applies in
general, not just

282
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,130
to this particular example.

283
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,720
So the definition
of R composed with V

284
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,270
is the p R composed
with Vj means

285
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,610
there's a D that connects
p and j through V and D,

286
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,060
in particular that
there's a D such that pVd,

287
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,172
which means there's a
V arrow from p to to d.

288
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:13,630
And dRJ-- there's an
R arrow from d to j.

289
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,308
For some, d.

290
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,560
By the way, there's
a technicality here

291
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,960
that when you write the
formula pVd and dRj, following

292
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,230
the diagram where you
start with V on the left

293
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,600
and follow a V arrow
and then and R arrow,

294
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,080
it's natural to think
of them as written

295
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,220
in left to right order of
which you apply first V R.

296
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,830
But of course, that's not
the way composition works.

297
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,940
When you apply, one function--
R to V to something,

298
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,640
you're applying V first.

299
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,210
And you write it on the right.

300
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,840
So R o V is written like
function composition

301
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,530
where V applies first,
but the logical statement,

302
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,260
the natural way to
write it, is to follow

303
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,970
the way the picture works.

304
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,400
And D, Vs, and Rs get reversed.

305
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,088
So watch out for that confusion.

306
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,119
Well, I want to introduce
one more relation to flesh

307
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,290
out this example, and that'll
be the teaches relation.

308
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,300
So the teaches relation
is going to have--

309
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,030
as domain professors, again--
and it's codomain, subjects.

310
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,849
And it's simply going to
tell us who's teaching what.

311
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:27,060
So here we're going to see
that ARM is teaching 6.042,

312
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,210
as you well know.

313
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,330
And FTL is teaching 6.042,
two which he does frequently

314
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,890
but not this term.

315
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,530
And now I can again use
my relational operators

316
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,650
to start making assertions
about these people

317
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,680
and relations involving
teaching and advisees.

318
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,390
And a useful way to do that
is by applying set operations

319
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,690
to the relations because I
can think of the relations

320
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,700
as being that set of arrows.

321
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,290
So suppose I wanted to make
some statement that a professor

322
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,660
should not teach their
own advisee because it's

323
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,992
too much power for one person
to have over a student.

324
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:11,200
This is not true, by the way.

325
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,830
It's common for professors
to teach advisees,

326
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,740
but there are other
kinds of rules

327
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,010
about dual relationships between
supervisory relationships

328
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,135
and personal relationships.

329
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,160
But anyway, let's
say if we can say

330
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,980
that profs should not teach
anyone one that they're

331
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,100
advising.

332
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,370
Well, if we were saying that in
logical notation, what we would

333
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,700
say is that for every
professor and subject,

334
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,310
it's not the case
that the professor has

335
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,070
an advisee in subject
j and the professor

336
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,124
is teaching subject j.

337
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:49,790
So that's how you
would say it in logic,

338
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,790
but there's a very
slick way to say it

339
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,620
without all the formulas
and the quantifiers.

340
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,880
I could just say that T, the
relationship of his teaching,

341
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,980
intersected with
the relationship

342
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,150
of has an advisee in
the subject is empty.

343
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:14,210
There is no pair of professor
and subject that is in both T

344
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,150
and in R of V.

345
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,740
And this bottom
expression here gives you

346
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,700
a sense of the
concise way that you

347
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,350
can express queries and
assertions about the database

348
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,760
using a combination of
relational operators

349
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,870
and set operators.

350
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,860
Another way to say it
by the way-- there's

351
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,490
a general set theoretic
fact-- is the way

352
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,870
to say that T and R of
V intersected is empty

353
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,630
is to say that the set T and the
set R of V, whatever they are,

354
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,460
have no points in common.

355
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,780
An equivalent way to
say that is that one set

356
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,490
is contained in the
complement of the other set.

357
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,060
So I could equally well have
said this as R composed with V

358
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,310
is a subset of not T.

359
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,330
Well, let's step back
now and summarize

360
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,370
what we've done by example
and say a little bit

361
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,170
about how it works in general.

362
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,020
So as I said, a binary
relation-- and we'll

363
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,470
start to be slightly more
formal now-- a binary relation

364
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,250
R from a set A to a set B
associates elements of A

365
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,330
with elements of B.

366
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,570
And there's a picture
of a general set

367
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,880
A called the domain
and a general set B

368
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,590
called the codomain.

369
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,090
And R is given by those arrows.

370
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,150
Well, what exactly are arrows?

371
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,840
Well, if you're going
to formalize arrows,

372
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,610
the set of them is what's
called the graph of R.

373
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,710
So technically, a relation
really has three parts.

374
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,860
It's not to be identified
with just its arrows.

375
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,620
A relation has a
domain and codomain

376
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,194
and some bunch of arrows
going from the domain

377
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:54,860
to the codomain.

378
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,400
The arrows can be
formalized by saying all

379
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,430
that matters about an arrow is
where it begins where it ends

380
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,430
because it's just
designed to reflect

381
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,520
an association between
an element of the domain

382
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,370
and an element of the codomain.

383
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,840
So technically, the arrows
are just ordered pairs.

384
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,170
And in this case, there are
three arrows-- one from A

385
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,230
to b 2.

386
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,770
And so you see at the bottom of
the slide an ordered pair a 1,

387
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,290
b 2.

388
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,700
Another arrow goes
for a 1 to b 4.

389
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,445
So you see the
ordered pair a 1, b 4.

390
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:32,680
And the final arrow is a 3, b 4.

391
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,300
And you see that pair.

392
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,420
So all the language
about arrows is really

393
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,140
talking about ordered pairs.

394
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,220
It's just that the
geometric image

395
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,750
of these diagrams
and their arrows

396
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,170
makes a lot of
properties much clearer.

397
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,010
So the range of R is
an important concept

398
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,620
that comes up regularly
and tends to be

399
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,330
a little confusing for people.

400
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,040
The range of R is
simply the elements

401
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,630
with arrows coming
in from R. It's

402
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,440
all of the elements that
are hit by an arrow that

403
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,980
starts in the domain.

404
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,400
So it's really R of the
domain is the range of R.

405
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Now, notice that
this is typically not

406
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,790
equal to the whole codomain.

407
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,310
Let's look at this example.

408
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,430
Here, the range
of R-- the points

409
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,740
that are hit by elements of
A under R, namely just b 2

410
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,460
and b 4.

411
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,506
The codomain has elements b
1 and b 3 that are missing

412
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:39,755
and that are not in the range.

413
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,050
Well, as I said, functions are
a special case of relations.

414
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,130
So let's just look at that.

415
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,240
A function, F, from
a set A to a set B

416
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,500
is a relation which
associates with each element

417
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,255
in the domain-- each element
little a and the domain capital

418
00:22:57,255 --> 00:23:04,350
A-- with at most one
element of the codomain B.

419
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,730
So this one element, if it
exists, is called F of a.

420
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:13,190
It's the image of the element
a under the relation F,

421
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,120
but what's special about it is
that F of a contains at most

422
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,390
one element.

423
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,110
So let's just look
at an example again.

424
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,080
A way to say that a
relation is a function

425
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,320
is to look at all of the points
on the left in the domain

426
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,530
and make sure that none of them
have more than one arrow coming

427
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,180
out.

428
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,810
Well, in this picture, there are
a couple of violations of that.

429
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,060
There are a couple
points on the left in A

430
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,220
that have more than
one arrow coming out.

431
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,070
[? There's ?] our two bad edges.

432
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,960
But if I erase those, now
I'm left with a function.

433
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,160
And sure enough, there's at
most one arrow coming out

434
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,320
of each of the points on the
left in A. Some of the points

435
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,510
have no arrows coming out.

436
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,870
That's fine.

437
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,200
And so for those green
points with an arrow out,

438
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,460
there's a unique F of the
green point equal to a magenta

439
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,980
point in B that's uniquely
determined by the functional

440
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,010
relation F, which may
not be defined for all

441
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,791
of the green points if they
don't have any arrow coming out

442
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,290
of them.

443
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,605
So function means less than or
equal to 1 arrow coming out.

444
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,020
So if we set this
formally without talking

445
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,620
about the arrows,
one way is simply

446
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,980
to say that a
relation is a function

447
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,460
if the size of F of little a is
less than or equal to 1 for all

448
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,470
of the domain elements A.

449
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,150
And a more elementary
way to say it

450
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,130
using just the language
of relations and equality

451
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,940
and Boolean
connectives is to say

452
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,500
that if a is connected
to two things

453
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,110
by F-- if aFb AND aFb
prime-- then in fact

454
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,690
b is equal to b prime.

455
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,680
And that wraps up functions.
