1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,620
PROFESSOR: So now we start
on a new unit called counting

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,329
or combinatorics.

3
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:06,620
And it's about counting things.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,911
Now one of the things that
happens when you're counting

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:13,090
is your typically adding
up a bunch of numbers

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,920
that you've counted
along the way.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,736
And so you wind up needing
to deal with sums a lot.

8
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:20,110
And so let's start with those
mathematical preliminaries.

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,360
We're going to look at three
kinds of sums, arithmetic

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,730
sums, geometric sums,
and harmonic sums.

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,430
All of which come
up very regularly.

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,390
And they all have
reasonably nice formulas

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,330
that explain what they sum to.

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,820
Let's begin with the simplest
ones of arithmetic sums.

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,910
So there's an example.

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,200
This supposedly is
the kind of problem

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,530
that was assigned to children
in the the 18th century

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,610
to keep them busy in class.

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,170
And the great mathematician
Gauss, Carl Friedrich Gauss,

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,180
whom you know for magnetism
and from probability theory,

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,530
but also in fact the
inventor of congruence

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,520
and the number theory
that we've studied,

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,710
showed his brilliance
as a child prodigy.

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,570
When he was nine-years
old, supposedly, he

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,640
noticed that in that short
of numbers, that we just saw,

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,840
there were 30
numbers, and each one

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,900
was 13 greater than
the previous one.

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,499
The idea being that
the tutor didn't

29
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,790
want to go through the effort
of summing everything up.

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,880
He knew the trick to
get the sum quickly,

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,420
but he kept his
students busy for hours

32
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,220
doing that kind of problem.

33
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,740
I don't know whether that
this is a true story or not,

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,656
but it's a good story.

35
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,850
So let's go on with it.

36
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,880
So in other words,
what Gauss noticed

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,010
was that the numbers on that
page looked like 89 and 89

38
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,170
plus 13 down through the 30th
number 89 plus 29 times 13.

39
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,300
And then he saw how to get
the sum of a simple expression

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,290
for the value of this sum.

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,830
And the logic is that
let's call the first term F

42
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,050
and then the next term is F plus
2 d-- F plus d, where d is 13

43
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,540
and F is 89.

44
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,530
Next one would be F plus
2 d down to the end.

45
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,910
And I'm going to
call the last term L,

46
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,169
which is 89 plus 29 times 13.

47
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,430
And this would be L minus
d or 89 plus 28 times 13.

48
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,720
And let's call that sum A.
We don't know what it is yet,

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,070
but we're very quickly
going to derive it.

50
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,000
One of the standard tricks to
find nice formulas for sums

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,120
is to find a arithmetic
relation between the sum

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,140
and a slight
perturbation of the sum.

53
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,950
In this case, I'm just going
to write the sum backwards.

54
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,300
So it's the same
sum A, but written

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,310
where the first term is last
and the last term is first.

56
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,380
And now notice what happens
when I add up these two sums.

57
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,190
I get 2A of course.

58
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,450
But every one of these terms--
this is a F plus L. This

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,000
is a F plus d plus L minus D.
It's F plus L. This last one is

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,540
an F plus L.

61
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,400
Every one of these
pairwise subsums

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,070
comes out to be
F plus L. And now

63
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,280
we have a formula for the whole
series in my simple formula

64
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,810
that A is equal to the
sum of the first term

65
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,160
plus the last term divided by
2 times the number of terms.

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,216
By the way, the first term
plus the last term divided by 2

67
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,840
maybe is more memorable
if you remember

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,360
that it's the average term.

69
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,240
It's the average size term
times the number of terms.

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,230
And that's how you sum
up an arithmetic sum.

71
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,870
So we can wrap up with a
familiar example, namely

72
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,840
the sum of the
integers from 1 to n.

73
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,270
This is an arithmetic
series, starts with one.

74
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,540
And the d, that
is the difference

75
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,110
from successive terms is simply
1, 1 plus 1, 1 plus 1 plus 1

76
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,680
down to n.

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,780
And according to
our formula, it's

78
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,160
the first plus the last over
2 times the number of terms.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,680
And we have that
familiar formula

80
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,830
for the sum of the
first n integers.
