PROFESSOR: Independent events
are events that have nothing

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,080
to do with each other.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,900
And needless to say, it's a
lot easier to work with them

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,400
because you don't
have to figure out

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,810
some weird interaction
between two events that

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,480
do have something to
do with each other.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,200
Typical case where
independent events come up

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,160
is, for example, you
toss a coin five times,

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,520
and then you're about to
toss a coin the sixth time.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,070
Is there any reason
to think that

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,250
what the coins did the
first five times is going

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,000
to have any
influence on the flip

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,720
of the coin for the sixth time?

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,100
Well, it's reasonable
to assume not,

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,780
which is to say that the
outcome of the sixth toss

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,690
is arguably independent
of the outcome of all

17
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,450
the previous tosses.

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,170
OK.

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,570
Let's look at a
formal definition

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,660
now in this short
video of just what

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,520
is the technical definition
of independent events.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,741
So what we said is that they
are independent if they have

23
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:55,990
nothing to do with each other.

24
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,820
What that means is that if
I tell you that B happened,

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,220
it doesn't have any effect on
the probability of A. That is,

26
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,350
the probability of A,
given that B happened,

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,130
doesn't change the
probability of A at all.

28
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,196
That's it.

29
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,320
Now this is one definition.

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,153
Maybe this is the more
intuitive definition.

31
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:16,440
But another definition that's
equivalent and is standard

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,260
is that two events are
equivalent if the product

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,252
of their probabilities is
equal to the probability

34
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:24,210
that they both happen,
that is, the probability

35
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,760
of their intersection.

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,890
Now definition one
and definition two

37
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,800
are trivial equivalent,
just using the definition

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,239
of conditional probability.

39
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,280
And if you don't see that,
this would be a moment

40
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,100
to stop, get a pencil
and paper, and write down

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,440
the three-line proof of the
equivalence of these two

42
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,220
equalities.

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,260
In fact, the three-line proof
has this as the first line

44
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,426
and that as the second line.

45
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,800
So you could argue it's
really just the middle line

46
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,120
that you're adding.

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,070
OK.

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,560
Definition two has the slight
advantage that it always works,

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,720
whereas definition
one implicitly

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,390
requires that the divisor--
remember probability of A given

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,390
B is defined as the probability
of the intersection divided

52
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,789
by the probability B. It's only
defined if the probability of B

53
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,820
is positive.

54
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,930
Whereas the second
definition always works,

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,450
so we don't have
to put a proviso

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,827
in about the probability
of B being non-zero.

57
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:19,535
So that's the definition
of independence.

58
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:24,970
Looking at this definition,
what you can see immediately

59
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,087
is that it's completely
symmetric in A and B.

60
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:28,545
Since multiplication
is commutative

61
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:31,735
and intersection is
commutative, which is A

62
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,320
and which is B doesn't matter.

63
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,820
And what that implies then
is that A is independent of B

64
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,370
if and only if B is
independent of A.

65
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,660
Now another fact that holds is
that if the probability of B

66
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,010
happens to be zero,
then vacuously B

67
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,550
is independent of
everything-- even itself.

68
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,880
Which isn't important, but is a
small technicality that's worth

69
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,450
remembering by that definition.

70
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,470
Now again, the intuitive idea
that A and B have nothing

71
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,100
to do with each other is that
A is independent of B means

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,600
that A is independent of
whether or not B occurs.

73
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,630
That is to say, if A
is independent of B,

74
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,400
it ought to be independent
of the complement of B.

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
And that's a lemma that's
also easily proved.

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,940
A is independent
of B if and only

77
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,890
if A is independent of
the complement of B.

78
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,050
It's a simple proof using
the difference rule.

79
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,370
And again, I
encourage you to stop

80
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,090
with a piece of
paper and a pencil

81
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,235
and convince yourself that that
follows with a one-line proof.
