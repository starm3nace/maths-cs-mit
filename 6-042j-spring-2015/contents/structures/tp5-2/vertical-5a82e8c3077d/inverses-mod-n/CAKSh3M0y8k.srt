1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,860
PROFESSOR: So, now we come to
the place where arithmetic,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,530
modulo n or
remainder arithmetic,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,580
starts to be a little bit
different and that involves

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,309
taking inverses and cancelling.

5
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:13,100
Let's look at that.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,000
So first of all,
we've already observed

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,970
that we have these
basic congruence rules

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,430
that if a and b are congruent
then c and d are congregant,

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,570
then a plus c and b
plus d are congruent,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,430
a times c and b times
d are congruent.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,030
So, that's the sense in
which arithmetic mod n is

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,080
a lot like ordinary arithmetic.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,402
But here's the main difference.

14
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:34,360
Let's look at this one.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,560
8 times 2 is 16,
which means it's

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,810
congruent to 6 mod 10, which
is the same as 3 times 2.

17
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,160
So, 8 times 2 is
congruent to 3 times 2.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,550
And you'd be tempted,
maybe, to cancel the twos.

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,560
And what happens then, well
then you could discover that you

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,920
think that 8 is congruent
to 3 mod 10, which it ain't.

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,940
So in short, you can't
cancel arbitrarily.

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,614
You can't cancel two, in
this case in particular.

23
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:05,030
So, that leads, naturally, to
the question of when can you

24
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,970
cancel a number?

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,990
When can you cancel a number k
when both sides of inequality

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,530
are multiplied by k and
I'd like to cancel k?

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,570
And the answer is simple,
when k has no common factors

28
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,840
with a modulus n.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,860
So, the proof of that is
based on the following idea.

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,740
Let's say that a number k
prime is an inverse of k mod n.

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,330
If k prime times k is
congruent to 1 mod n.

32
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,190
So, k prime is like 1 over
k with respect to mod n.

33
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,180
But of course, 1 over k is going
to be a fraction unless k is 1.

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,080
And so, k prime is going
to be an integer that

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,980
simply acts like 1 over k.

36
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,640
So, how are we
going to prove this?

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,860
And it's going to turn out to be
an easy consequence of the fact

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,370
that the gcd is a
linear combination.

39
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,170
So, how am I going to
prove-- find this k

40
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,400
prime that's an inverse of k?

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,300
Well remember, given
the gcd of k and n is 1,

42
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,300
I have a linear combination
of k and n is 1.

43
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,380
So, s times k plus
t times n is 1.

44
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,590
But if you stare at that for
a moment, what that means

45
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,080
is that k prime is simply
the coefficient s of k.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,380
So, all you have to do is
apply the pulverizer to k and n

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,300
to get the coefficient s of k
in the linear combination of k

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,470
and n is equal to 1.

49
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,990
Let's look at that
slightly more carefully

50
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,010
and see what's going on.

51
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,107
I have that sk plus tn is 1.

52
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:41,190
So, that means in particular,
since they're equal,

53
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,500
they're certainly congruent
to each other, modulo n.

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,090
sk plus tn is
congruent to 1 mod n.

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,400
But, n is congruent to 0 mod n.

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,750
So, this becomes t times 0, and
we're left with sk congruent

57
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,040
1 mod n, which is exactly
the definition of s

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,180
being an inverse of k.

59
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,550
Now, I can also cancel k if
it's relatively prime to n.

60
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,460
And the reason is that if I
have ak equivalent to bk mod n

61
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,350
and the gcd of k
and n is 1, then

62
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,640
I have this k prime
that's an inverse of k.

63
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,920
So, I just multiply both
sides by the inverse

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,350
of k, namely k prime.

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:32,220
And I get that the left hand
side is a times k, k inverse.

66
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,810
And the right hand side
is b times k, k inverse.

67
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,010
And of course, that's a times
1 is equivalent to b times 1.

68
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,430
And so, a is
congruent to b mod n.

69
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,420
So I can cancel, in
that case, trivially.

70
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,970
And in fact, you can work out
the converse implications.

71
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,000
The punch line of this--
well first of all, this

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
is the cancellation rule.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,950
You can cancel providing
that the gcd of k and n

74
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,360
is 1 if k is
relatively prime to n.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,710
So, this is the summary.

76
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,990
[? k is ?] cancelable
mod n if and only

77
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,130
if k has an inverse mod n, if
and only if the gcd of k and n

78
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,930
is 1, which I can restate as
k is relatively prime to n.

79
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,964
And that's the story.
